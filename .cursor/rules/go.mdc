# Your rule content

- Error messages should be declared as a pre-formatted variable and reused by all tests instead of hardcoded strings.
- Always run `make test` to verify changes.
- All test cases' timeouts should be less than 10 seconds.
- All unit tests should use a table testing approach.
- All unit tests should use a blackbox testing approach and add a `_test` suffix to the package.
- All unit tests should use mocks to avoid actual network requests.
- Code should be split into different smaller files to do only one job.
- Prefer pointers over concrete structs for function parameters, unless it is a DTO, which should be passed by value to avoid side effects.
